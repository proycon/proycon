👋 *Hello! Hallo! ¡Hola! Olá! Salut! Ciao! Saluton! Привет! 大家好！السلام عليكم *

My name is *Maarten van Gompel*, also known as *proycon* on the internet.
For more information about me, please visit [my homepage](https://proycon.anaproy.nl).

I am trying to migrate off GitHub as I don't like using anything owned by
Microsoft or US big-tech in general. You can find most of my recent projects on
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/proycon) and/or
[Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon) and/or [the KNAW HuC GitLab
instance](https://gitlab.huc.knaw.nl/) (for work-related projects). Reporting issues via
those other git forges rather than here is always preferred.

**Main Tools:** 🐧 Linux, 🦀 Rust, 🐍 Python, 🐚 Shell, Neovim

## Notable projects

* [My CLI tools for text processing](https://proycon.anaproy.nl/posts/my-cli-tools-for-text-processing/) - A blog posts where I link to various **NLP** tools I wrote over the years at work. Including, but not limited to [STAM](https://annotation.github.io/stam/), [Analiticcl](https://codeberg.org/proycon/analiticcl), [Colibri-Core](https://codeberg.org/proycon/colibri-core)
* [STAM](https://annotation.github.io/stam/) - Stand-off Text Annotation Model
* [SXMO](https://sxmo.org) - A minimalist desktop environment for Linux mobile devices, and [wvkbd](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon/wvkbd), a virtual keyboard for wayland.
* [Textsurf](https://codeberg.org/proycon/textsurf) - Webservice for efficiently serving multiple plain text documents or excerpts thereof (by unicode character offset), without everything into memory.
* [Codemetapy](https://codeberg.org/proycon/codemetapy) - A Python package for generating and working with [codemeta](https://codemeta.github.io).
* [Vocage](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon/vocage) - A minimalistic spaced-repetion vocabulary trainer (flashcards) for the terminal
* [Todo.txt more](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon/todotxt-more) - Extensions for todo.txt: interactive rofi/fzf control, sync github issues, better colors, time tracking... and more!
