👋 *Hello! Hallo! ¡Hola! Olá! Salut! Ciao! Saluton! Привет! 大家好！السلام عليكم *

My name is *Maarten van Gompel*, also known as *proycon* on the internet.
For more information about me, please visit [my homepage](https://proycon.anaproy.nl).

I am trying to migrate off GitHub as I don't like using anything owned by
Microsoft or US big-tech in general. You can find most of my recent projects on
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/proycon) and/or
[Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~proycon) and/or [the KNAW HuC GitLab
instance](https://gitlab.huc.knaw.nl/) (for work-related projects). Reporting issues via
those git forges rather than here is always preferred.

**Main Tools:** 🐧 Linux, 🦀 Rust, 🐍 Python, 🐚 Shell, Neovim

## Some notable projects
